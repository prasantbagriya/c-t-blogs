# Hostinger API CLI

`hapi` is the command line interface for the [Hostinger API](https://developers.hostinger.com).

## Installation

Download the binary for your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/hostinger/api-cli/releases).

## Configuration

Create `$HOME/.hapi.yaml`:

```yaml
api_token: <your API token>
```

or set the `HAPI_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Generate a token at
[hPanel → API](https://hpanel.hostinger.com/profile/api).

## Usage

```
hapi <group> <subgroup> <verb> [args] [flags]
```

Examples:

```
hapi billing catalog list
hapi vps virtual-machines list
hapi vps vm start 123          # vm is an alias for virtual-machines
hapi dns records list example.com
```

Output format defaults to a table; use `--format json|table|tree` to change it.
Command documentation lives in [docs/](docs/), and `manifest.json` maps every
API operation to its command. Shell autocompletion: see
[AUTOCOMPLETE.md](AUTOCOMPLETE.md).
